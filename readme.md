My application is a top down esque role playing game built entirely in terminal and with text graphics.
Similar to other rpg games the user will input directional commands to move the character on the screen
and explore a graphically created world where they can encounter events and ultimately win the game.
The game takes inspiration from the legend of zelda as well as pokemon however will aim to provide
the audience with a unique experience.
As python is limited in inputs the user will type out full commands to move the character rather than
short button presses. e.g. "Move Left 5".
The user will also select from multiple choice options where their
decisions will have an impact on the outcome of the game.
It aims to provide users with a brief form of entertainment to temporarily relieve stress and boredom.
The application serves as a prototype to demonstrate how a fully fleshed out game could be made to run within terminal.
Because of this the target audience is anyone who is interested enough to invest time into playing the game.
